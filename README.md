## Fuel Routing Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Fuel Routing Project! This project uses Django, pandas, Geoapify, and OpenRouteService to calculate the best route between two locations and estimate the total fuel cost. This app is designed to optimize your journey and help you save money on fuel by identifying the best fuel stops along your route.

## Features
Route Calculation: Calculate the best route between two locations using the Geoapify API.

Fuel Stops Identification: Identify the best fuel stops along the route with their prices.

Cost Estimation: Estimate the total fuel cost for the journey.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors and logs them.

API Integration: Integrate with multiple APIs for geocoding and routing.

## Technologies Used
Python

Django: Web framework for building the application.

pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

requests: Library for making HTTP requests.

Geoapify API: For geocoding and routing.

OpenCage API: For fetching coordinates.

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fuel-routing-project.git
cd fuel-routing-project
Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

plaintext
GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_geoapify_api_key
OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY=your_openrouteservice_api_key
OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_opencage_api_key
Usage
Run the enhance_fuel_prices_csv.py script to fetch and cache coordinates:

bash
python enhance_fuel_prices_csv.py
Run migrations:

bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:

bash
python manage.py runserver
Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000

Parameters:

start_location (string): The starting location address.

finish_location (string): The finishing location address.

Response:

json
{
  "route": {...},
  "fuel_stops": [...],
  "total_cost": ...,
  "map_url": "..."
}
